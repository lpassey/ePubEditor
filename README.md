# ePubEditor

**ePubEditor** is a Java program designed to create and edit ePub files in their native form.
Its UI is written using Java Swing, although the intent is to create a new fork which will
use JavaFX for its user interface.

**ePubEditor** currently supports ePub version 2.x, but work is underway to add support for
ePub versions 3.x.

I have two target audiences for ePubEditor: people who have created an e-book in HTML format, 
and now want a quick and easy way to turn it into an ePub, and people who have ePubs that do 
not display well on their devices because of "over-styling" and who want to clean up those 
ePubs for their own purposes.

User documentation for **ePubEditor** can be found at [https://lpassey.github.io/ePubEditor](https://lpassey.github.io/ePubEditor).

For instructions on how to create a new ePub, see [https://lpassey.github.io/ePubEditor#new](https://lpassey.github.io/ePubEditor#new).

For instructions on how to import, edit and clean an existing ePub, see [https://lpassey.github.io/ePubEditor#import](https://lpassey.github.io/ePubEditor#import)

As always, project and source code files can be foud here, at [https://www/github.com/lpassey/ePubEditor]

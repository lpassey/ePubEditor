    <h4>The history of the ePub file format</h4>

    <p>
        The ePub file format had its genesis in 1999 with the publication of the
        <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20101212183516/http://idpf.org/oebps/oebps1.0/download/oeb1-oebps.htm">Open
        eBook Publication Structure 1.0 (OEBPS) </a> by the Open eBook Forum, a consortium
        of individuals representing publishers, reading system vendors, software
        developers and experts in relevant web standards. A maintenance release of the
        specification was released in July of 2001 to clarify some parts of the original
        specification, but without substantive changes.
    </p>

    <p>
        Over-simplifying, OEB defined a collection of files that together would comprise
        an e-book, together with a newly invented OEB package file which specifies the OEB
        documents, images, and other files that make up the OEB publication and how they
        relate to each other. According to the specification:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            "A publication conforming to this specification must include exactly
            one OEB package file, which specifies the OEB documents, images, and
            other objects that make up the OEB publication and how they relate
            to each other.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is recommended that all package files use extension ".opf", in
            order to make them readily identifiable within the group of files
            making up a publication."
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Note that the acronym "OPF" originally signified "OEB Package File", and
        not "Open Packaging Format" as the <a href="http://idpf.org/">International
        Digital Publishers Forum</a> (IDPF) subsequently rebranded it.
    </p>

    <h5>OEB Content Documents</h5>

    <p>
        The Open eBook Forum envisioned that the primary file format in an OEBPS
        publication would be HTML (at the time, HTML 4 was the most current
        version of HTML). The decision by the Open eBook Forum to make HTML the
        exclusive document format of the OEBPS was an excellent one, for a number
        of reasons. (Other types of files could be included in the publication
        structure, but only to support the HTML content files.)
    </p>

    <p>
        In the first place, HTML was, and still is, the most open document format
        around. It is a plain text format, which means that HTML can be edited
        and viewed by the most simple of editors. The markup is comprised of
        elements surrounded by angle braces (&lt;&gt;); character entities are
        provided if a literal angle brace needs to be represented (&amp;lt; and
        &amp;gt;). It is relatively easy to understand and master (at least as
        compared to other document formats) and there is a lot of free and
        open-source software (FOSS) available to manipulate and display HTML files.
    </p>

    <p>
        Secondly, HTML is a semantic language not a presentational one. This means
        that the marked-up text is defined by what it is, not by how it looks.
        Example of semantic mark-up in HTML include the paragraph (&lt;p&gt;)
        the list, ordered and unordered (&lt;ol&gt; and &lt;ul&gt;), header and
        footer groups (&lt;header&gt; and &lt;footer&gt;) as well as header
        lines at various levels of significance (&lt;h1&gt;...&lt;h6&gt;). A
        table (&lt;table&gt;) is a document structure containing rows
        (&lt;tr&gt;) and columns (&lt;td&gt;). There are over 100 semantic
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">elements</a>
        in HTML.
    </p>

    <p>
        The greatest advantage to semantic mark-up, in my opinion, is that it
        makes a document highly adaptable to the user agent displaying it, and to
        the reader reading it. ("User agent" is the technical term for software
        that displays a document for an end user.) According to Oxford languages,
        a paragraph is "a distinct section of a piece of writing, usually dealing
        with a single theme and indicated by a new line, indentation, or numbering."
        If a section of text is marked as a &lt;p&gt;aragraph, the user agent
        displaying it can choose whether to display it as an intendented section,
        a block section (unindented but separated from other paragrphs by a blank
        line), a numbered section, or even a section beginning with a paragraph
        character (&para;). Usually the default presentation of a semantic element
        can be set by the end user running the user agent.
    </p>

    <p>
        The adaptability is important because an eBook is intended to be read
        on a wide variety of devices, from cell phones to desktop web browsers,
        and what is desirable presentation on one device may not be desirable
        on another. Take, for example, line justification. Justified lines (where
        every line begins and ends at the same margin on the screen) can give a
        highly professional look on a wide screen, but on a narrow screen (such
        as a cell phone) they can look quite odd as the individual words are
        padded with a lot of white space to make the lines even. In this case,
        "ragged-right" text can be both more pleasing and more understandable.
    </p>

    <p>
        The adaptablity of HTML allows one to create documents that are
        "reflowable", that is one where line length changes depending on
        the width of the screen. Anyone who has tried to read a PDF file
        on a cell phone understands just how annoying it can be to be
        required to scroll the text from side to side to read a document.
        Because HTML is adaptive, a user agent can decide which segments
        of text are appropriate to reflow (e.g paragraphs) and which are
        not (e.g. tables).
    </p>

    <h5>The OEBPS Container File</h5>

    <p>
        One of the major shortcomings of the OEBPS was that it did not propose any
        sort of single file publication structure, explicitly stating that "This
        specification does not define means for physically bundling files together
        to make one data transfer object (such as using zip or tar)."
    </p>

    <p>
        In 2004 I approached Jon Noring, one of the original participants in the Open
        eBook Forum with an idea for an OEBPS container based on the ZIP file format.
        My idea was a fairly simple one similar to that used by the Java Archive (JAR)
        format: as well as including all the OEBPS files in a ZIP archive, it would also
        include a required META-INF folder containing a single file which must be named
        "container.xml" and which would point to the ".opf" file which defined the rest
        of the publication.
    </p>

    <p>
        The purpose of the "container.xml" file stored in a known location was to morph
        the container file from a "data transfer object" into a single file that could
        be used by ebook reading software to reconstruct the publication as a whole.
        To promote this new format, and to develop a prototype ebook reading system,
        Jon and I, together with a few like-minded individuals formed the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenReader_Consortium">Open
        Reader Consortium</a>, created a couple of Yahoo discussion groups, and sent
        <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/rec.arts.books/c/3MHa0lh5ea8/m/ETKaE2Nln9IJ">invitations</a>
        to the nascent ebook community to join us.
    </p>

    <p>
        Unfortunately, the Open Reader Consortium never gained much traction and has
        since been placed in "<a href="http://jonnoring.net/OpenReader/index.html">cold storage</a>."
        It did, however, have a
        <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170118033049/http://blogs.adobe.com/billmccoy/2007/01/openreader_vict.html">significant
        impact</a> on the later development of the "ePub" format. The IDPF's specification for the
        "<a href="http://idpf.org/epub/20/spec/OCF_2.0.1_draft.doc">Open Container
        Format</a>" (the development of which I participated in as an "Invited
        Expert") is, in practice, virtually identical to the format I originally
        proposed to Jon Noring.
    </p>
    <details>
        (The actual IDPF specification permits additional but purely optional and
        no doubt proprietary XML files to be added to the META-INF folder.
        Additionally, the container.xml file could contain references to multiple
        ".opf" files which would a single container file to hold multiple publications.
        In my somewhat limited experience I have never seen a publication that
        contains more than the required "container.xml" file, or more that a
        single publication referenced in that file.)
    </details>

    <p>
        In January of 2017 the IDPF was
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/01/pressrelease-idpf-w3c-combination.html.en">merged
        into the W3C</a>, and itself went into "cold storage."
    </p>

    <h4><b>ePubEditor</b> purpose and goals</h4>

    <p>
        In 2011 I started work on this project, <b>ePubEditor</b>, a Java&#8209;based
        project which was designed to edit ePub files in their native form, and
        which used Java Swing for its user-interface code. The source code was
        originally hosted at
        <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/epubeditor/">SourceForge</a>,
        and more recently revived and copied to
        <a href="https://github.com/lpassey/ePubEditor">GitHub</a>.
        It is my intention moving forward to upgrade the project to JavaFX and
        add whatever additional functionality may be required to support the
        newest version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB">ePub</a>
        (currently 3.2).
    </p>

    <p>
        I have two target audiences for <b>ePubEditor</b>: people who have created
        an e-book in HTML format (or a format easily converted to HTML), and now
        want a quick and easy way to turn it into an ePub; and people who have
        ePubs that do not display well on their devices because of "over-styling"
        by publishers and who want to clean up those ePubs for their own purposes.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>ePubEditor</b> is designed to be a fairly literal interpretation of the OEB
        Package File (.opf) which is a required part of every ePub. The package file
        is an XML file that contains sections to describe various parts of an ebook.
        The &lt;manifest&gt; section of the file contains a list of all the files that
        make up the publication, not only XHTML content, but referenced images, CSS
        style sheets, font files, and anything else required to make a complete publication.
    </p>

    <p>
        The &lt;spine&gt; section of the package file contains references to
        items in the &lt;manifest&gt; which form the primary reading order of
        the publication. It does <em>not</em> contain references to <em>all</em>
        of the items in the manifest, only to those which are designed to be
        presented directly to the reader. These spine items can be thought of
        as the "chapters" of the publication. <strong>
            Order is important
            here
        </strong>; when an ePub is opened, the content files will be presented
        to the human reader in exactly the same order as they appear in this section.
    </p>

    <p>
        The &lt;metadata&gt; section contains details <em>about</em> the publication
        but which are not part of publication itself, such as the names of the author
        and contributors, the title of the publication, the publisher identity, ISBN
        numbers and other identifiers. The &lt;metadata&gt; section was originally
        intended to contain only metadata defined by the
        <a href="https://dublincore.org/">Dublin Core Metadata Initiative</a>
        but it has since been expanded to include any arbitrary metadata
        via the use of the &lt;meta&gt; tag.
    </p>

    <p>
        Lastly, the package file contains a &lt;guide&gt; section. This section
        is designed to provide references to various significant parts of the
        publication such as the cover image, the table of contents, and the start
        of the actual content. This section is intended to be used by reading
        system software, not the human reader, but I'm not aware of any software
        (other than perhaps Adobe Digita Editions) which takes advantage of this data.
    </p>

    <h4>ePubEditor operation</h4>

    <p>
        When you start the program <b>ePubEditor</b>'s opening screen will have 5
        tabs, roughly corresponding to the publication sections of the .opf file.
        At this point, the current tab will be the Manifest table.
    </p>

    <p>
        Before attempting to edit any ePub file, you may want to set up your tool
        preferences. At the bottom of the Manifest tab there are 5 buttons, one of which
        is the "Edit" button. When you select a file on the Manifest tab and press the
        "Edit" button it will launch an editor to allow you to edit the file.
    </p>

    <p id="Editor">
        The selection of an HTML editor is a very personal one. So how does
        <b>ePubEditor</b> know what your preferred editors are? The answer is that
        you tell it. When you select the Tools&#8209;&gt;Editors from the menu bar,
        you will be presented with a dialog box that lists media-types and the
        executables that are used to edit them.
    </p>

    <img src="Editors.png" style="max-width: 95vw" />

    <p>
        To add an editor to this list you must
        know where on your computer the executable file resides. This can sometimes be
        challenging on Windows platforms because Microsoft makes a concerted effort to
        hide this information from you. If you don't know where an executable file is
        found on Windows, find the shortcut you use to launch the application.
        Right&#8209;click on the icon or the program listing in the start menu and select
        "properties". The "Target" value will be the location of the executable. If you
        are a Mac user I can't tell you how to find the location of the executable.
        If someone could help me out I would appreciate it. If you're a Linux user,
        you already know how to find an executable's location.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the Tools&#8209;>Editors dialog, press the "Add" button. Yet another dialog
        box will open where you can select a media-type that this editor will handle. Press
        the "Browse" button and a file system browser will open that will let you navigate
        to the executable's location in the file system. Select the executable in the
        browser dialog, and press "Select". The path to the executable will be set in
        "Add" dialog. Lastly, edit the command line options, if necessary. "%s" will
        be replaced with the name of the file to be edited; usually this is sufficient,
        but if more command-line options are required you can set them here.
    </p>

    <p>
        On my system I have set Microsoft's Visual Studio Community Edition with the
        HTML11 extension as my editor for XHTML, IntelliJ IDEA as my editor for HTML,
        and TextPad 5 as my editor for CSS files. These assignments are not exclusive;
        you may use a single application as an editor for all media types, although
        an entry needs to be added for each media-type you wish to edit. On the other
        hand, you cannot select multiple editors for a single media-time; if you
        attempt to do so the previous editor selected for that media-type will be
        overwritten. Older versions of Microsoft Word can work as an HTML editor
        if you are careful to only use semantic styles when editing your files.
        Avoid Adobe InDesign and most other WYSIWYG editors as they tend to focus
        on presentation and not semantics.
    </p>

    <p>
        Editors are not limited to text files like HTML or CSS. On my system I
        have set up GIMP as my image editor but any image editor that accepts
        a command-line file name could work. I have used IrfanView in the past
        and it worked well. Microsoft Paint is an acceptable alternative. If
        you have the money you could even use Photoshop or PaintShop Pro.
    </p>

    <p>
        Simply add a new editor selection for that media-type. You cannot edit
        your selections of the Tools&#8209;&gt;Editors screen
    </p>

    <p>
        While you are setting up your editing tools you should also set up other
        preferences. Tools&#8209;>Preferences allows you to set local paths for your
        temporary files folder, and your xsl file folder. The purpose of the xsl file
        folder will be explained later when we discuss editing existing ePub files. Here
        you can also specify the default CSS file that will automatically be added to
        all new ePub publications.
    </p>

    <p>
        Editor and path preferences are stored using the Java Preferences class.
        The backing store for this class is operating system dependent, which means
        the actual mechanism may differ based on the Operating System <b>ePubEditor</b>
        is running on. On Windows preferences are stored in the System Registry,
        whereas on Linux preferences are stored in a file in the user's home directory.
        The upshot of this decision is that the preferences will have to be set for
        every machine that <b>ePubEditor</b> runs on.
    </p>

    <h4>Creating a new publication</h4>

    <p>
        When you select File&#8209;&gt;New, <b>ePubEditor</b> will start a new
        publication in the working directory/folder you select.
    </p>

    <p>
        The "Manifest" table will show a list of all the files that will be
        included in the publication. When you start a new ePub, you should
        see three files in the Manifest table: ebook.css, toc.html, and
        cover.jpg. "toc.html" and "cover.jpg" should be marked with a red "stop"
        symbol, indicating that while they are listed in the the manifest they
        do not exist on the file system. You can remove them from the manifest,
        or better yet you can create them. Once the files exist (and the window
        is refreshed) the red "stop" will turn to a green "check."
    </p>

    <img src="./newEPub.png" style="max-width:95vw" />

    <h5>Add</h5>

    <p>
        On this screen there is an "Add" button. When you press this button,
        a file system browser will appear and allow you to add one or more
        files to the publication. When a file is added to the publication it is
        copied to the publication's working folder.
    </p>

    <p>
        When you add a file to the publication, <b>ePubEditor</b> attempts to
        "intuit" its media-type based on the file extension. It will then present
        a dialog box asking if you want to add the file to the content list. If
        you say yes, the file will be flagged as being part of the content, a
        reference to it will be added to the "Content" table, and it will eventually
        become part of the ePub's &lt;spine&gt;. If the media-type is not correct,
        you should change it to match its actual media-type. Only certain media-types
        are allowed in ePubs, and the "media-type" field contains a drop-down
        selector containing only those media types. If the HTML file is
        XML&#8209;compliant (ie, XHTML) it should have a media-type of
        "application/xhtml+xml"; otherwise, it probably has a media-type of
        "text/html". Typically, only (X)HTML files should be added to the
        content list.
    </p>

    <p>
        If a manifested file is deleted from the file system the Manifest entry will
        remain, but the file indicator icon will change to the red "stop" symbol when
        the screen is refreshed.
    </p>

    <h5>Remove</h5>

    <p>
        The "Remove" button allows you to remove a file from the publication. When
        a file is removed from the publication it is also removed from the Content
        table if it was part of the content, but it is <em>not</em> removed from the
        file system. The file will not be part of the compiled ePub, but it will remain
        in the working folder in the file system for future reference.
    </p>

    <h5>Edit</h5>

    <p>
        When the "Edit" button is pressed, ePubEditor attempts to launch the editor
        associated with the declared media-type. (see the <a href="#Editor">preferences
        setup</a> discussion earlier in this document.)
    </p>

    <h5>Split HTML</h5>

    <p>
        It is possible that you will be creating an ePub from an existing single
        large HTML file. In this case you may want to split the one large file
        into smaller files for better maintenance, such as one file per chapter.
        <b>ePubEditor</b> allows you to split up an HTML file into multiple files
        by specifying an HTML element which is the split point.
    </p>

    <p>
        As an example, the Project Gutenberg version of <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>,
        by Charles Dickens has each chapter sectioned into a &lt;div class="chapter"&gt;
        element. Suppose you add the PG file to a new ePub and set the media-type
        correctly. When you select the file and press the "Split" button you will be
        presented with a dialog box that will ask for the HTML element which will be
        the split point.
    </p>

    <img src="TOTC-Split.png" style="max-width: 95vw" />

    <p>
        When you press the "Split" button the original file will be split
        immediately before the selected element and you will end up with 49 new
        HTML files numbered consecutively. If the original file was part of the
        Content table, each of the new files will be added to the Content table
        as well. Each new file will have the same &lt;head&gt; section (and thus
        all the same style and meta data) but the body will contain only the text
        following and including the split point element and up to the next
        occurrence of the split point element. The new files will be assigned
        the same media-type as the original file. The original file will be removed
        from the Manifest, but it wil not be deleted from the file system.
    </p>

    <p>
        The function of the "Transform" button will be discussed later in the
        section on editing existing ePubs.
    </p>

    <h5>The Content Tab</h5>

    <p>
        The Manifest shows all files that will be included in the ePub container,
        but only files listed in the "Content" will be presented directly to the
        reader. Order is unimportant in the Manifest table, but items in the
        Content table will be presented by the reading system in the order they
        are listed in the Content table. Therefore, on the Content tab in addition
        to the "Add" and "Remove" buttons, there are buttons to move file references
        up and down.
    </p>

    <img src="Content.png" style="max-width: 95vw" />

    <p>
        Pressing the "Add" button will add a reference to the Content table of
        the first content file (HTML, XHTML) in the Manifest table which is
        not yet already in the Content table. Future enhancements will include
        the ability to explicitly select one or more candidate files. The "Remove"
        button will remove the selected file from the Content table, but it will
        not remove it from the Manifest table. The "Move Up" and "Move Down"
        buttons will move the selected file reference up or down in the Content
        list.
    </p>

    <h5>Adding publication metadata</h5>

    <p>
        Metadata about the book can be entered or edited on the "Authors and
        Contributors" tab, or on the "Properties" tab. Even though this metadata
        is stored in a single &lt;metadata&gt; section of the OEB Package File,
        data about authors and contributors is separate from other properties
        in <b>ePubEditor</b>. This is because these two sets of metadata have
        different attributes. Contributors have roles, and a File As attribute
        (usually a contributor's name is entered as it would be displayed, and
        the "File As" property is last name first. It is possible that the
        author's name may be a pseudonym whereas the "File As" attribute may be
        the author's given name). The contributor's role is selected from a
        drop-down list of allowed roles. If a contributor's role is not in the
        drop-down list "other" should be selected.
    </p>
    <p>
        As to other properties, every ePub must have at least one identifier
        which is globally unique, a title, and a language attribute. These
        additional properties are show on the "Properties" tab. When a new ePub
        is created these properties are populated with default values. The "title"
        property is set to "Title of this work", the identifer is set to a random
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">UUID</a>
        value, and the language is set to "en". These property values should be
        changed to values which are meaningful to your publication. For example,
        the identifier value may be changed to the ISBN of the publication (if
        it is known) in which case the identifier's "Other Attribute" should be
        changed to 'opf:scheme="ISBN"'. Other <a href="http://idpf.github.io/epub-registries/identifiers/">identifier
        schemes</a> are "DOI" for Digital Object Identifiers and "JDCN" for Japan
        Digital Comic Number. If the identifier does not represent one of these
        types the "opf:scheme" attribute should be omitted.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Properties table will also show an entry for the ePub's working
        directory (aka "epubeditor:rootPath") which is shown only for information
        purposes; it will not be included in the ePub file when compiled.
    </p>

    <h5>The Guides Tab</h5>

    <p>
        The "Guides" table may contain references to various
        <a href="http://idpf.org/epub/20/spec/OPF_2.0.1_draft.htm#Section2.6">significant
        parts</a> of the publication such as the cover image, the table of
        contents, any indexes and the start of the actual content. The actual
        &lt;guide&gt; section of the .opf file has been deprecated in ePub version
        3.3 in favor of an XHTML document utilizing the new HTML5 &lt;nav&gt;
        element. <b>ePubEditor</b> does not yet support creation or maintenance
        of the new ePub Navigation Document; users should continue to use the Guides
        table until such time as support has been added.
    </p>

    <p>
        While there are no &lt;guide&gt; entries required by the specification
        in ePub documents, <b>ePubEditor</b> uses the "cover" entry to discover
        any image that will become part of an HTML cover wrapper file, and the
        "toc" entry to identify the table of contents file name that will be
        used when generating a new Table of Contents. These entries must be
        present before attempting to automatically generate either of these files.
    </p>

    <h5>Navigation: Tables of Content and the .ncx file</h5>

    <p>
        Virtually every ePub should have a Table of Contents (TOC), which is why
        <b>ePubEditor</b> adds a "toc.html" Manifest enty to every new publication.
        If your publication already has a Table of Contents (which should exist
        in its own file) you can select the existing TOC by removing the
        auto-generated "toc.html" file entry from the Manifest table, then
        selecting your own TOC file and changing the "id" value to "_toc".
    </p>

    <p>
        In cases where you do not already have a Table of Contents, selecting
        Edit&#8209;&gt;Build&#160;TOC from the main menu (or pressing Ctrl&#8209;T)
        will cause <b>ePubEditor</b> to generate an XHTML formatted Table of
        Contents for the publication as a whole using ordered lists (&lt;ol&gt;).
        Each header becomes a list item, and each time a header level changes a
        new, embedded unordered list is started. When the entire list is
        successfully created, it is saved as an XHTML file and added to
        the manifest.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, if your publication files use &lt;h2&gt; for "Part" headings
        and &lt;h3&gt; for chapter headings, <b>ePubEditor</b> will create a TOC
        similar to the following:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <ol style="list-style:none;margin-left: -2em">
            <li>&lt;ol&gt;</li>
            <li>
                &lt;li&gt;Part One<ol style="list-style:none">
                    <li>&lt;ul&gt;</li>
                    <li>&lt;li&gt;Chapter I&lt;li&gt;
                    <li>&lt;li&gt;Chapter II&lt;li&gt;
                    <li>&lt;li&gt;Chapter III&lt;li&gt;
                    <li>&lt;/ol&gt;
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>&lt;/li&gt;</li>
            <li>
                &lt;li&gt;Part Two<ul style="list-style:none">
                    <li>&lt;ol&gt;</li>
                    <li>&lt;li&gt;Chapter IV&lt;li&gt;
                    <li>&lt;li&gt;Chapter V&lt;li&gt;
                    <li>&lt;li&gt;Chapter VI&lt;li&gt;
                    <li>&lt;/ol&gt;
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        etc.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        When the IDPF was developing the specification for ePub 2.0, certain
        businesses interests advocated forcefully for the required inclusion of
        an NCX file (Navigation Control file for XML) in every compliant ePub.
        The file, the format of which was developed for Digital Talking Book
        (DTB), contains a hierarchical table of contents for the EPUB file.
        As an XML file it was not designed for display to a reader, but
        required a reading system to parse the file and render the information
        in some proprietary manner.
    </p>

    <p>
        A description of the format of the NCX file is beyond the scope of
        this document.
    </p>
    <p>
        While the 2.0 specification <em>required</em> every ePub to contain an
        NCX file, it only suggested that reading system software <em>should</em>
        support it. To my knowledge, very few reading system did. Once the IDPF
        was merged into the W3C, the NCX file was deprecated and ePubs are no
        longer required to include one.
    </p>

    <p>
        In any event, should you desire to add an NCX file to your publication,
        <b>ePubEditor</b> provides an automated function to create an NCX file,
        similar to the behavior of the autogenerated Table of Contents. An NCX
        file is generated by selecting Edit&#8209;&gt;Build&#160;NCX from the
        main menu. Refinement of the generated NCX file is left as an exercise
        for the reader.
    </p>

    <h5>Adding a cover image</h5>

    <p>
        When a new publication is started in <b>ePubEditor</b> it automatically
        creates an entry in the Manifest table for a cover image, with the file
        name "cover.jpg". The entry is marked with the red "stop" icon to
        indicate that while the file is manifested, it does not exist in the
        file system. Before an ePub can be compiled the cover image must be
        provided, or the Manifest entry must be removed.
    </p>

    <p>
        Only HTML files are presented to the user, so even if a cover image is
        present, it cannot be shown directly. Instead, it must be wrapped as an
        &lt;img&gt; element in an HTML file. A wrapper file can be created by
        selecting Edit&#8209;&gt;Build&#160;Cover from the main menu.
    </p>

    <p>
        To create a cover wrapper file <b>ePubEditor</b> scans the "Guide" table
        for an entry of type "cover". If the "cover" entry does not exist in the
        Guide, or if the specified image file does not exist on the file system,
        an error message will be displayed. Otherwise a new HTML file will be
        created with a name that is the same as the .opf file name plus "_cover"
        (if the publication has not yet been saved, the new cover file name will
        be simply "_cover.html"). The cover image will be embedded in an
        &lt;img&gt; element with a style attribute of "max-width: 99vw;
        max-height: 99vh". "vh" and "vw" are percentage values of the "viewport"
        which means that the cover image will always fit on the reading system's
        screen without have to scroll up to down or right to left.
    </p>

    <p>
        Once your publication is
        internally consistent you may compile it to an ePub.
    </p>

    <h4>Editing and cleaning an existing publication</h4>

    <p>
        As mentioned earlier, semantic HTML has huge advantages as ePub content
        documents. Examination of ePub files from commercial publishers, however,
        demonstrates conclusively that when it comes to HTML, commercial publishers
        are almost totally clueless.
    </p>

    <p>
        HTML 4 was intended to be a mostly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_HTML">semantic
        markup language</a>, and its successor, HTML 5 is even more so, with
        the addition of new semantic elements, such as &lt;figure&gt;, &lt;abbr&gt;,
        &lt;address&gt;, &lt;aside&gt; and &lt;data&gt;. The styling of these semantic
        elements was designed to be accomplished by reference to an external
        style-sheet, usually known as "Cascading Style Sheets", or CSS.
    </p>

    <p>
        For a good example of how various style sheets can affect (and effect)
        the display of a document, visit <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">CSS
        Zen Garden</a>. The interesting thing about the CSS Zen Garden is that
        every view is exactly the same document; only the stylesheet changes!
    </p>

    <p>
        By changing a style sheet an end-user can cause a user agent to
        present an HTML document in a way that is most satisfying to that user.
        As a simple example, a paragraph is almost universally defined as "a
        collection of one or more complete sentences, usually dealing with a
        single theme and indicated by a new line, indentation, or numbering."
        While most printed works use a seriffed font to present a paragraph,
        in most cases on a computer screen a sans-serifed font is more
        understandable. And while justified lines are often preferred on
        relative wide computer screens, line justification is quite ugly on
        narrow screens such as a cell phone, tablet or PDA. Lastly,
        &lt;p&gt;aragraphs on browsers are almost always rendered as blocks,
        separated by a blank line, whereas in most printed material a paragraph
        is indicated by an indentation. Which of these alternatives is
        preferable is largely a matter of taste.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are two tags in HTML that are intentionally free from semantics:
        &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt;. The &lt;div&gt; tag is intended to hold
        a number of other elements and by default is rendered as a block of
        text (text that begins on a new line and causes a new line to begin
        afterwards). The idea behind these elements is that
        additional semantics can be added to a document by adding a "class"
        attribute to one of these elements that indicates the new semantics.
        The &lt;span&gt; tag is intended to mark a snippet of text within
        other tags.
    </p>

    <p>
        An example of appropriate use of a &lt;div&gt; tag might be to hold
        a glossary, a set of footnotes, or a poem e.g. &lt;div class="glossary">.
        An example of an appropriate use of a &lt;span&gt; tag might be to
        mark a snippet of text as a foreign language, e.g. &lt;span
        class="foreign" lang="fr"&gt;sous vide&lt;/span&gt;. The spanned
        text may need to be displayed differently, such as in an alternate
        font, of could be used by a spell checker to check the spelling of
        foreign words.
    </p>

    <p>
        An unfortunate side-effect of relying on CSS for styling is that it is
        possible to use these generic elements to assign styles to a segment of
        text without adding any new semantics. For example, &lt;div
        style="text-indent:2em"&gt; could create an indented block of text that
        looks just like a paragraph, but may or may not be one. &lt;span
        style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"&gt; would cause a snipped of text
        to be rendered in a different font without any indication of of <em>why</em>
        that snippet is distinguishable from the surrounding text.
    </p>

    <p>
        Even more unfortunate is that there is no way to prevent semantic elements
        from being used as generic elements; the number one culprit here is the
        &lt;p&gt;aragraph element. It is virtually impossible for a computer
        program to intuit the semantics of a section of text based on its
        presentation. If you were to select "View Page Source" in your browser
        you would see that this paragraph is inside &lt;p&gt; tags. But if you
        were instead to use &lt;div class="para"&gt; a computer couldn't
        distinguish between the two. Likewise, the computer couldn't tell the
        difference between &lt;h1&gt;ePubEditor User Documentation&lt;/h1&gt;,
        which is the top-level header of this document, and &lt;p style="..."&gt;ePubEditor
        User Documentation&lt;/p&gt;, where the style attribute mimics the style of
        the header element.
    </p>

    <p>
        I think it fairly obvious that a Table of Contents is semantically a
        list, the items of which may contain other lists. The W3C certainly
        thinks so as it mandates a human-readable Table of Contents in ePub 3.0
        using lists. According to the
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/epub3/epub-packages.html#sec-package-nav">specification</a>,
        "The ol child of the nav element represents the primary level of content
        navigation. Each list item of the ordered list represents a heading,
        structure or other item of interest."
    </p>

    <p>
        A sample Table of Contents satisfying the ePub specification might be:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        <pre>
&lt;nav class="toc"&gt;
    &lt;h2>CONTENTS&lt;/h2>
    &lt;ol>
        &lt;li>PROLOGUE&lt;/li>
        &lt;li>PART I
        &lt;ol>
            &lt;li>ONE&lt;/li>
            &lt;li>TWO&lt;/li>
        &lt;/ol>&lt;/li>
    &lt;/ol>
</pre>
        etc...<br /><br />

        Which would be rendered as follows:
        <h2>CONTENTS</h2>
        <ol style="list-style:none">
            <li>PROLOGUE</li>
            <li>
                PART I
                <ol style="list-style:none">
                    <li>ONE</li>
                    <li>TWO</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
        etc...
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        On the other hand, consider the following snippet from a Table of Contents
        Contents from a recent publication by Tom Doherty Associates:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
<pre>
    &lt;p class="contentsHead" style="text-indent: 0%;"&gt;
        CONTENTS
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class="toc1" style="text-indent: 0em;"&gt;
         PROLOGUE 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class="toc" style="text-indent: 0em;"&gt;
         PART I 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class="toc" style="text-indent: 1em;"&gt;
         ONE 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class="toc" style="text-indent: 1em;"&gt;
         TWO
     &lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
        etc...
    </blockquote>

    <aside>
        (In both cases the &lt;a&gt;nchor tags have been omitted for ease
        of comprehension.)
    </aside>

    <p>
        Presumably, with the correct stylesheet, the TOR Table of Contents would
        look exactly like the W3C-compliant Table of Contents. But only a human
        could make the connection. I am not convinced that "CONTENTS" is a
        complete sentence (indeed, I am fairly certain it is not). The second
        example has lost all adaptability; without the availability of a very
        specific style sheet a user-agent could simply not present the TOC
        correctly. And if I am writing a program to find all the headers in a
        document, text in a &lt;p&gt; element is not going to be a candidate
        even if it has a class name of "contentsHead".
    </p>

    <p>
        This last observation is not speculative. The very method <b>ePubEditor</b>
        uses to build a TOC is to scan each file referenced in the Content table
        in reading order and add each header value found (and a link to its location
        in the publication) into hierarchical, ordered lists. Any user agent will
        be able to present an acceptable version of the Table of Contents even
        without any special style specification.
    </p>

    <p>
        When it comes to inflexible, unadaptable typography, there is virtually
        nothing as non-adaptive as pigment on wood pulp. I suspect that much
        of the failure of commercial publishers to understand HTML is the fact
        that they have lived for centuries in the world of ink and paper. The
        notion that a publication can dynamically alter its presentation based
        upon the reader's preferences is utterly incomprehensible to them.
    </p>

    <p>
        Because computers cannot derive semantic meaning from text presentation,
        just about no WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) HTML editor can
        produce a semantic HTML file without significant human oversight. The
        human being using the editor must be able to recognize that a header,
        or the caption on an image, are not paragraphs and must be identified
        accordingly when the file is generated. And because most human typesetters
        are steeped in th world of ink and paper they are unlikely to provide
        the required oversight. Add this to the fact that most WYSIWYG editors
        use the &lt;p&gt; tag as a generic (non-semantic) element what you have
        is a recipe not for disaster, but certainly for failure.
    </p>

    <p>
        As a result of this state of affairs, I don't believe I have ever seen
        a commercially produced ePub that can comfortably be read on my preferred
        reading system (an Android phone with the CoolReader app) without extensive
        "cleaning." The second goal I had for <b>ePubEditor</b> was to create an
        application that can clean the kind of overstyled, generic markup common
        in commercial publications.
    </p>

    <h4>Importing an existing ePub</h4>

    <p>
        An existing ePub can be opened in <b>ePubEditor</b> by selecting
        "File&#8209;&gt;Import&#160;from&#160;ePub" on the main menu. When you
        elect to import an ePub a file system browser will open allowing you
        to select an existing ePub on your file system.
    </p>

    <img src="Import.png" style="max-width: 95vw" />

    <p>
        As noted above, an ePub file is just a specialized version of a zip file;
        when you press the "Open" button <b>ePubEditor</b> will create a new folder
        in your working folder which will have the same name as the ePub file but
        with a ".d" extension, and will extract all the files from the ePub into
        the newly created temporary folder.  So, if you were to open "Oliver 
        Twist - Charles Dickens.epub" all the publication's files would be 
        extracted into a folder named "Oliver Twist - Charles Dickens.epub.d".
        <b>ePubEditor</b> then opens the container.xml file from the META-INF 
        directory, reads the "rootfile" entry to determine the name of the .opf 
        file, opens that file to load the publication structure, then remembers
        that the publication's working folder is the newly created temporary folder.
    </p>
